## What I learnt


I've been learning about REST APIs and getting better at documenting and testing software with tools like pytest. Working on real problems has been a great way to develop my problem-solving skills, even though debugging can still be tough. Collaborating with others has really helped me understand how everything fits together. I still have a lot to learn, but this experience is really helping me grow in API development and software testing, setting me up for the future.
